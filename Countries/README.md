# The Project Brief: IPTV Logo Collection

### What is this?
This project is a personal mission to build a comprehensive, organized library of IPTV channel logos categorized by country. High-quality, consistent logos make any media player look better, and I noticed how hard it can be to find them all in one place, so I'm building that place for myself and anyone interested.

### Current Status
I am currently gathering logos country by country, with focus on United Kingdom as a start. This is a "work in progress" project, meaning I’ll be adding more folders and assets whenever I have the spare time.

### Project Structure
To keep things clean, the repository is organized by geographic region:

* **Folders by Country:** Each country has its own dedicated folder (e.g., /USA, /UK, /Canada).
* **File Naming:** I aim for clear naming conventions so logos are easy to map to your .m3u playlists.

### 🛠 How to Contribute
Since this is a massive undertaking, help is always welcome!

* If you have high-quality logos for your region, feel free to open a Pull Request.
* If you notice a missing channel or a broken link, open an Issue.

### 📝 A Note on Updates
I add to this repo as often as my schedule allows. If your country isn't here yet, feel free to contribute to it!
